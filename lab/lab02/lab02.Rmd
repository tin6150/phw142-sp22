### Visualizing global cesarean delivery rates and GDP across 137 countries

The proportion of pregnant women who undergo cesarean deliveries varies dramatically across countries. In the US, the cesarean delivery rate is around 33%. A 2018 study in the British Medical Journal found that cesarean delivery rates ranged between 0.6% in South Sudan and 58.9% in the Dominican Republic.^1^

Over the course of this lab and the first problem set, we will study the relationship between countries' cesarean delivery rates and their gross domestic products (GDPs).^2,3^ 

In today's lab we will:

- import the data,
- familiarize ourselves with the dataset, 
- explore the univariate distributions of the key variables.

If you haven't already, begin by knitting this document by clicking the "Knit" button above. As you fill out this lab, you can re-knit (click the button again) and see how the document changes. 

Let's get started!

Click the green arrow icon in the top right corner of the gray chunk below to execute the three lines of code in the code chunk, or execute them line by line by placing your cursor on the first line and hitting cmd + enter on Mac or ctrl + enter on PC. If you do not want messages produced by loading `dplyr` to print in your knitted document, toggle `message = TRUE` to `message = FALSE` in the code chunk options. Re-knit your file and notice the difference in the output:

```{r load-libraries, message = TRUE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

- The `library` command loads the packages into memory. 
- The `readr` library contains function for reading in data.
- The `dplyr` library contains functions we will use to manipulate data.
- The `ggplot2` library contains functions to visualize data.


The data on each country's cesarean delivery rate is stored in a comma-separated-values (csv) file. We can load that data and assign it to an object called `CS_data_raw` by running the code below. Click the green arrow in the line below to run the code. (Note that the green arrow will run all the code in this code chunk, not just the first line of code):

```{r read-in-the-data}
CS_data_raw <- read_csv("data/cesarean.csv")

##View(CS_data_raw)
##
library(readr)
#//View(CS_data_raw)

# The code below re-orders the variable Income_Group in the specified order.
# Note that it *does not* change the order of the data frame (like arrange() does)
# Rather, it specifies the order in which the data will be plotted. 
# This will make more sense when we plot the data using Income_Group, and then again using Income_Group_order

CS_data_raw <- CS_data_raw %>% 
  mutate(Income_Group_order = forcats::fct_relevel(Income_Group, "Low income", 
                                              "Lower middle income", "Upper middle income", 
                                              "High income: nonOECD", "High income: OECD"))

### df CS_data_raw is reassigned to itself!
### so think of this as appending column to existing df.
### mutate end up adding new column,  named Income_Group_order
### new col created using forcats::fct_relevel()
### if one do:
str(CS_data_raw)
### it shows that the new column store "Factor" types data, albeit View() doesn't show any difference
### Income_Group_order: Factor w/ 5 levels "Low income","Lower middle income

### later on still need to use pull() and levels() to ??? 
```

Look at the environment tab (top right pane) and make sure you see your dataset there. Click on `CS_data_raw` in that pane. This will open the data viewer tab. Take a quick look at the data and then switch back to the "lab02.Rmd" file and move to the next step.

When you receive a dataset you will also often receive a data dictionary that tells you what each variable means. Below is an example of a dictionary for this dataset:

| Variable        | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Country_Name    | The name of the country                             | 
| CountryCode     | 3-digit unique country identifier                   |           
| Births_Per_1000 | The number of births per 1000 people in the country |
| Income_Group     | The income group the country is categorized into    |
| Region          | The geographic region the country belongs to        |
| GDP_2006        | The gross domestic product (GDP) of the country in 2006 |
| CS_rate         | The percent of births that were delivered by cesarean section |
| Income_Group_order | The "ordered" version of Income_Group |

\newpage 

### Look at your newly imported data

In four separate code chunks, type `str(CS_data_raw)`, `dim(CS_data_raw)`, 
`names(CS_data_raw)`, and `head(CS_data_raw)`. Execute each code chunk and study the output.

```{r keep-exploring-the-data-1}

# YOUR CODE HERE
str(CS_data_raw)
```

```{r keep-exploring-the-data-2}

# YOUR CODE HERE
dim(CS_data_raw)
```

```{r keep-exploring-the-data-3}

# YOUR CODE HERE
names(CS_data_raw)
```

```{r keep-exploring-the-data-4}

# YOUR CODE HERE
head(CS_data_raw)
```

**1. In your own words, what do these functions do?**

- `dim()`: dimension of the data table, ie how many columns and rows.

- `str()`: structure of the data table,    which is very interesting, display various column names, what types of data in there, and a sampling of data in such column!  very neato!

- `names()`: display the column heading names ie field names.

- `head()`: unix head command!  display the first X lines, if X is given as param.


**2. Based on these functions' outputs, who/what are the individuals in this dataset? How many of them are there?**

countries.

\newpage 

### Add a new variable

**3. [3 points] Right now, `CS_rate` is presented as a number between 0 and 1. For plotting, it will be nice to have the proportion displayed as a number between 0 and 100. We can accomplish this using `dplyr`'s `mutate()` function to add a new variable called `CS_rate_100`. Write one line of code to add this variable to the dataset and assign this new dataframe to an object called `CS_data`.**

```{r}
CS_data <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
CS_data

# YOUR CODE HERE


CS_data = CS_data_raw %>% mutate( CS_rate_100 = CS_rate * 100 ) 



```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q3.R")
```

### Examine the distribution of income and geographic regions

**The countries in the dataset represent a wide range of income levels and geographic regions.**

**4. Which variable groups the countries by income regions?**

Income_Group

**5. Which variable groups the countries by geographic regions?**

Region


These variables are categorical variables. So far in lecture, we've seen categorical variables stored as `chr` variables when we've examined `str(data)`. However, `Income_Group_order` is stored as a `Factor` variable in this dataset, which is another way to store categorical data. One benefit of storing it as `Factor` is that we can re-order the `Factor` variable in a way that makes sense for plotting and analysis. To see the values and order of a factor variable, we can use the following code.

## Factor  (wk2 Lab video 1 ~10:50)

**STOP: Remove eval = F from this chunk header before continuing on.**
```{r levels-income, eval = T}
##CS_data %>% pull(Income_Group_order)

CS_data %>% pull(Income_Group_order) %>% levels()
# You won't be tested on writing the line of code above. 
# Try and understand what the code is showing you.


```
\newpage 

**6. [1 point] Because `Income_Group` and `Region` are categorical, we make bar charts to represent their distributions. Using the `ggplot()` code you learned during lecture, make a bar chart showing the number of countries per income group using `Income_Group` and assign this plot to `p6`.**

```{r}
p6 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p6

# YOUR CODE HERE

### i need to bloody do a count before I can plot!
### ha, geom_bar will do this automagically!


## bar chart!  not histogram!
## x = income group (categories)
## y = number of countries in the given X

## Lab video 2.1 [12:40]

##CS_data = CS_data_raw %>% group_by(Income_Group) %>% summarize(mean_GDP_2006 = mean(GDP_2006))
##head(CS_data)
##?summarize
###ggplot(CS_data,aes(x=CountryCode, y=GDP_2006)) # + 
###p6 = ggplot(CS_data,aes(x=Region, y=Income_Group))  +
p6 = 
  ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=Income_Group)) + geom_bar()
  ### geom_bar() is the implicit y-axis,
  ### here didn't specify stats="identity", so it counted the x axis var (Income_Group)

p6
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q6.R")
```

\newpage 

**7. [1 point] Now make the bar chart using `Income_Group_order`.**

```{r}
p7 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p7

# YOUR CODE HERE
p7 = 
 ggplot(CS_data, aes(x = Income_Group_order)) + geom_bar()

p7
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q7.R")
```

**8. Do you prefer the plot using `Income_Group` or `Income_Group_order`? Why?**

Income_Group_order, it is an ordinal variable and should be arranged this way.

**9. Did you use the argument `stat="identity"` in the code to make this bar chart? Why or why not?**

No i did not, and this is what tricked me!  Didn't fully understand this till watched the Lab video (the precise version, thx!!)

\newpage 

**10. [1 point] Make a bar chart showing the number of countries per geographic region.**

```{r fig.width = 11}
p10 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

p10 = ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=Region)) + geom_bar()
p10

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q10.R")
```

**11. Based on your plot, which world region has the most countries in the dataset?**

Europe and Central Asia


**12. Which geographic region has the fewest number of countries in the dataset?**

North America


**Try changing the fig.width! Note that the code chunks where you made your plots had the chunk option "fig.width = 11". Try changing the setting to a lower number, like 9, and re-running the chunk. Notice how the width of the rendered plot changes. Change it back to 11 so that the x-axis labels don't look too cramped.**

### Examine the distribution of `GDP_2006` and `CS_rate_100` across countries 

**13. [1 point] `GDP_2006` and `CS_rate_100` are quantitative, meaning that we use histograms rather than bar charts to examine their distributions. Using code you learned in class, make a histogram of `GDP_2006`. Pay attention to the message that R outputs when running your code. It is telling you that by default the data is grouped into 30 bins for plotting.**

```{r}

### x: GDP
### y: count of countries with the GDP  ---> done by geom_histogram() !  and histogram cuz var is continuous (ie numeric)
### which is why later used binwidth to adjust x-axis grouping
p13 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p13 = ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=GDP_2006)) + geom_histogram()
p13

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q13.R")
```

**14. [1 point] Rather than letting R choose the number of `bins`, we can set `binwidth = number` within the `geom` function to choose the width of the bins. Try setting the binwidth to different values and see how it changes the plot.**

*To choose a binwidth, look at the x-axis of the histogram you just made. Because we are plotting GDP across a wide variety of countries, it might make sense to choose a binwidth in the 1000s. Thus, the range of the variable matters when choosing a good binwidth.*

```{r}
p14 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE

p14 = ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=GDP_2006)) +
 geom_histogram( col = "green" , binwidth = 5000 )

p14

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q14.R")
```

\newpage 

**15. [1 point] Next, make a histogram for cesarean delivery rates using the variable `CS_rate_100`. First run your code without a set binwidth and then add the `binwidth` argument with an appropriate value.** 

```{r}
p15 <- NULL # Redo one of your plots here

p15 = ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=CS_rate_100)) +
  #geom_histogram( col = "green" )
 geom_histogram( col = "green" , binwidth = 10 )
p15

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q15.R")
```

\newpage 

### Polish up your plots

**Your plots look great so far, but let's get them ready to present at a meeting or in a report. To do this, please update the plot and axes titles (using `labs`), and change the `fill` or `color` of the bars. Here is a [big list](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) of colors that you can use to chnage the `col` and `fill`. For example `col = "orchid1"` will change the color to a pinky-purple.**

**16. [1 point] Present your final plots with updated titles, labels, colors, and fills below. To do this, extend the ggplot code you wrote above with the functions and arguments just described.**

```{r, fig.width=11}
p16 <- NULL # Redo one of your plots here
p16 = ggplot(CS_data, aes(x=CS_rate_100)) +
   geom_histogram( col = "orchid1" , fill = "purple",  binwidth = 10 ) +
  labs(x="Cesarian rate in %",
       y="Number of countries",
       title = "Global Cesarian Rate",
       caption = "Data from PH142 Lab02") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size=16)  # font size

p16

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q16.R")
```

\newpage 

### Save your plots to separate files

Sometimes you need to save plots as a PNG or JPEG to include in a PowerPoint presentation or submit to a research journal for publication. The `ggsave()` function is used to save plots as separate files. Quickly read the documentation of the `ggsave()` function by executing this code
which opens a help window in the bottom right pane:

```{r what-is-ggsave, eval = F}
?ggsave
```

**17. Use the documentation to attempt saving your plots in the code chunk below. Don't worry about producing an error or saving your plot in the wrong place -- that is all part of coding and learning new functions!**

*NOTE: the `filename` argument cannot be "lab02.Rmd"! This is the name of the lab file you are working in, so if you save the image of your plot as lab02.Rmd it will override all of the hard work you've done in this lab. Instead, call your image something like "CS_plot.png" and specify the `device` to be "png".*

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
ggsave( "lab02_cs_plot.png", plot = last_plot())
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

\newpage 

**When you are done, knit your R document one last time and ensure it looks good! Change anything you don't like. You can choose to knit to .docx or .pdf by selecting these options from the dropdown menu next to knit (in case you'd like to save the completed file onto your computer).** 

When you're happy with your work, please follow the instructions on the final page to submit.
