 - Check your working directory with `getwd()` 
   - You should be in the `phw142-sp22` folder
 - Knit early, knit often
   - It's the little blue ball of yarn under the tabs of open files. 
   - Ensures work is saved periodically and can correctly be outputted in your desired file format (e.g. PDF).
